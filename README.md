# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the project completed for the **Statistical Learning** course. The project focuses on a binary classification problem in the context of hotel bookings. Specifically, we aim to predict whether a reservation will be **"Canceled"** or **"Not Canceled"** based on various parameters in the dataset. Additionally, we analyze the key characteristics that influence the likelihood of a booking being canceled.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about hotel reservations and includes the following features:

- **Lead Time**: The number of days between the booking and the arrival date.
- **Number of Guests**: The total number of guests included in the reservation.
- **Stay Duration**: The total number of nights for the booking.
- Other relevant attributes that may influence the likelihood of a cancellation.

## Objective
The primary objectives of the project are:
1. **Prediction**: Develop a model to predict whether a reservation will be canceled.
2. **Feature Importance**: Identify the key factors that contribute to cancellations using regression methods.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution, identifying trends, and visualizing relationships between features and cancellations.
3. **Model Selection**: Utilizing regression and classification techniques to build a predictive model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Successfully predicted whether a reservation would be canceled.
- Identified significant features influencing cancellations, such as lead time and number of guests.
